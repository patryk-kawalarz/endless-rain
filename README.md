It's very intriguing to hear how sounds are constantly changing. So I wanted to give a longer life to your tracks. With "Endless Rain" you can create up to four MIDI waves, with different range, speed and channel/cc. The actual moment in time of every wave is visualised. 

I made this script in 6 hours and it was my first contact with Lua language, so I'm sure there are many things I could write better. I based on [Changes](https://llllllll.co/t/changes/33799) code and idea.

### Requirements

* Norns
* any device with MIDI input

### Documentation

You can do everything only using two encoders. 
- E2 - changes a parameter, one by one. 
- E3 - changes parameter's value.
Any wave starts when the Time parameter is higher than 0.
